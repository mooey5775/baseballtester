## Baseball Tester

Usage:

 - Open `tester.py` and update the `BASEBALL_EXE` variable to your compiled baseball program.
 - Run `python tester.py` (must be python>=3.6)

Alternate files can be tested without modifying `tester.py` by supplying your executable as an argument to tester.py (e.g. `python tester.py ./softball`)

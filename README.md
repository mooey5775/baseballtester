## Baseball Tester

### Usage

 - Clone the repo or download all files
 - Open `tester.py` and update the `BASEBALL_EXE` variable to your compiled baseball program
 - Run `python tester.py` (must be python>=3.6)

Alternate files can be tested without modifying `tester.py` by supplying your executable as an argument to tester.py (e.g. `python tester.py ./softball`).

### Report Problems

Solutions were generated from my program, which might not be entirely accurate. If you're finding that your program keeps failing a certain test case and you're sure it's right, let me know and I'll update the solutions if I think your correction is right.
